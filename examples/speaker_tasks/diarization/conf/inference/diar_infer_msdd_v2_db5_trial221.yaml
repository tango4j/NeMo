# This YAML file is created for all types of offline speaker diarization inference tasks in `<NeMo git root>/example/speaker_tasks/diarization` folder.
# The inference parameters for VAD, speaker embedding extractor, clustering module, MSDD module, ASR decoder are all included in this YAML file. 
# All the keys under `diarizer` key (`vad`, `speaker_embeddings`, `clustering`, `msdd_model`, `asr`) can be selectively used for its own purpose and also can be ignored if the module is not used.
# The configurations in this YAML file is suitable for telephone recordings involving 2~8 speakers in a session and may not show the best performance on the other types of acoustic conditions or dialogues.
