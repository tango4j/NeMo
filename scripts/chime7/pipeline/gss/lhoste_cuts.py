    Splits each input cut into as many cuts as there are supervisions.

        min_duration: An optional duration in seconds; specifying this argument will extend the cuts
            that would have been shorter than `min_duration` with actual acoustic context in the recording/features.

            If the supervision segment is longer than `min_duration`, the return cut will be longer.
        context_diraction: Which direction should the cut be expanded towards to include context.
            The value of "center" implies equal expansion to left and right;
            "random" uniformly samples a value between "left" and "right".
