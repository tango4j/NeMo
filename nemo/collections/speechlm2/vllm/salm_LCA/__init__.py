"""vLLM plugin registration for NeMo Speech LM with Long Context Audio (SALM-LCA).

Registers ``NeMoSpeechLMConfig`` and the single
``NeMoSpeechLMForConditionalGeneration`` model class with vLLM via the
``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point.

This variant of the SALM plugin bakes in long-context-audio support: when the
perception encoder is a ``ParallelExpertEncoder`` (Sortformer diarization +
ASR encoder), the model feeds the full audio as one long sequence and lets the
encoder run its own context-preserving online inference (``_forward_online`` with the
streaming Sortformer speaker cache / FIFO). Ordinary encoders still honor
``encoder_chunk_size_seconds`` via ``parts.encoder_chunking``.

A single model class covers every supported backbone family (standard
decoder-only LLMs like Qwen3, hybrid Mamba+MoE like NemotronH).
Backbone-specific behavior is selected at instantiation time.
