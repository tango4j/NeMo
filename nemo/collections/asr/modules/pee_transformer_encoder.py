Parallel Expert Encoder (PEE) for ASR / audio.

A PEE hosts several independently-trained *whole* encoders ("experts") inside a
single container module so they share one front-end, batching, and inference
entry point. Unlike a Mixture-of-Experts layer, **PEE does not route** tokens to
a sparse subset of experts: every expert preserves its own, unmodified inference
path and produces its own output. The only thing borrowed from MoE is the
*compute* trick -- the position-wise feed-forward (FFN) matmuls of
shape-compatible experts are batched into a single grouped-GEMM instead of being
issued as many small per-expert kernels.

Concretely:

- ``PEETransformerEncoder`` -- a container that owns N expert encoders
  (e.g. a multilingual-ASR :class:`MoETransformerEncoder`, a dense diarization
  :class:`TransformerEncoder`, a dense sound-event :class:`TransformerEncoder`)
  and exposes a per-expert forward that is bit-for-bit identical to running the
  original encoder standalone.
- ``GroupedFeedForward`` -- a numerically-exact, batched replacement for a list
  of same-shape :class:`FeedForward` modules. It stacks the expert weights and
  evaluates them with two batched matmuls (the portable grouped-GEMM stand-in
  for a fused CUTLASS/Triton grouped-GEMM kernel).
- Helpers to (a) **bucket** expert FFNs by shape so each grouped-GEMM call sees
  a uniform ``(d_model, d_hidden)`` and (b) **zero-pad** a narrow expert FFN up
  to a wider ``d_model`` when a single uniform grouped tensor is required.

The bucketing / padding helpers exist specifically to reconcile the heterogeneous
experts that motivate this module: the diarization (Sortformer) expert runs at
``d_model = 640`` while the ASR and sound experts run at ``d_model = 1280``,
yet all three share the same FFN hidden size of ``640``. See the module-level
"Reconciling the Sortformer FFN" note below and the project README for the
design rationale.

# make Sortformer participate, all of which MUST preserve its exact output (PEE's
# first principle):
#
#   (1) Zero-pad to (1280 -> 640 -> 1280). Pad W1's input side with 640 zero
#       rows and W2's output side with 640 zero columns; feed the 640-d Sortformer
#       activation in the top half (rest zero) and slice the top 640 outputs back.
#       Exact (zeros are structural), single uniform grouped tensor, but ~2x FFN
#       FLOPs/params for the (smallest) expert. Use ``pad_feedforward`` for this.
#
#   (2) Replicate the 640x640 weight twice to fill the 1280 input/output. NOT
#       recommended: replicating across both halves computes ``W1 @ x`` twice and
#       sums, i.e. ``2 * W1 @ x`` unless paired with a compensating 0.5 scale, so
#       it does not preserve the inference path for free and buys nothing over (1).
#
#   (3) Keep Sortformer's native (640 -> 640 -> 640) FFN as its own state dict and
#       place it in a SEPARATE shape bucket (its own grouped-GEMM group). Exact,
#       zero wasted compute, at the cost of one extra (small) GEMM group. This is
#       the recommended default; ``bucket_ffns_by_shape`` implements the grouping.
#
