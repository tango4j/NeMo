"""Parallel Expert Speech Encoder (PEE-v2).

Hosts the three PEE-v2 experts -- a multilingual-ASR MoE **speech** expert
(``d_model`` 2048), a Sortformer **speaker** expert (1024), and a **sound** expert
(2048) -- inside one :class:`GGEMMTransformerEncoder`, so a single
``forward_packed`` call runs all three: one batched SDPA over 40 packed heads
(16 + 8 + 16, all ``head_dim`` 128) plus one grouped GEMM per FFN bucket.

The speaker expert's states go through the Sortformer head
(``encoder_proj`` -> ``forward_speaker_sigmoids``) to produce per-frame speaker
activities, which are fused into the speech states (LayerNorm + sinusoidal
speaker kernel + ADD).

The sound expert is merged in per ``merge_sound_expert_to_asr``:

* ``False`` (default since v2.1.0) -- the SoundToken route. The sound expert's CTC
  head reads per-frame ``<ev:...>`` event and ``<sty:stt|end:...>`` style-span
  probabilities out of its states, and those are thresholded, LayerNorm-ed and
  injected through sinusoidal kernels: the direct analogue of the speaker branch, on
  disjoint sets of sinusoid rows. What reaches the ASR states is only the tags, a
  signal of rank <= ``n_sound_events + n_sound_styles``.
* ``True`` -- the whole sound representation instead: its encoder states are
  LayerNorm-ed, scaled and added onto the ASR states. This was the v2.0.0 default,
  used while the CTC head was still being trained.

Speakers, events and styles are three separate families: each has its own LayerNorm over
its own tags, its own block of sinusoid rows and its own scale. A single norm spanning
two families would make each one's code shift with the other's activity, and the sound
expert is much weaker on styles than on events, so the scales need to move apart.

Every family's rows are strided (see ``_TAG_ROW_STRIDE``) and its kernel calibrated so a
single active tag injects a vector of norm ``sqrt(d_model)``. That makes each ``*_scale``
a plain fraction of the ASR state magnitude, unaffected by how many tags the family holds
or which rows it was given -- so widening a family, or moving it, no longer silently
changes how loudly it speaks.

Order matters: sound joins the ASR states FIRST, so speech + sound together form
the backbone that ``asr_norm`` normalizes, and the speaker kernel is then added on
top of that normalized sum.

Only the **speaker** expert is frozen by default. Its kernel is built from a hard
threshold on the speaker activities, so no gradient reaches it through the fusion
regardless; speech and sound both train.

Two encoding modes, same fusion:

* :meth:`ParallelExpertEncoder._forward` -- one pass over the whole utterance.
  All three experts share ``T``, so there is no prefix and no padding.
* :meth:`ParallelExpertEncoder._forward_online` -- windowed long-form decoding
  where the speaker expert additionally attends over its streaming cache. The
  cache is passed as a ``prefix`` to ``forward_packed``, which right-pads the
  speech and sound experts to the speaker's longer ``T`` and masks each expert
  with its own length.

I/O matches :class:`ConformerEncoder` (drop-in). Expects un-normalised mels and
re-applies ``per_feature`` normalization internally. Because all three experts now
share one packed call over one input tensor, that normalization is computed once
and every expert sees the same normalised features. Only self-contained PE bundles
(inline ``speech_expert_cfg`` / ``speaker_expert_cfg`` / ``sound_expert_cfg`` /
``sortformer_modules_cfg`` in ``model_config.yaml``) are supported.

# in `token_weighting.{event,style}_prefixes`, which is where to look first if a

#
# `<spk:0>` / `<spk:1>` are deliberately left out: PEE gets speakers from the Sortformer

# table sit at ~0.97 cosine -- the very property that makes the table good at encoding
# position makes it bad at encoding identity.
#
# Two things go wrong with consecutive rows, both measured on the per-tag injection
# vectors rather than the raw rows:
#
#   * Tags become hard to tell apart. Worst within-family cosine at stride 1 is 0.858
#     (speakers, n_spk=8) and 0.927 (a 32-tag sound family); at stride 16 it is 0.163 and
#     0.231. Across families, the worst event-vs-speaker pair goes from 0.485 to 0.006.
#   * Tags become unequally loud. A tag's code is proportional to ``row_i - mean(rows)``,
#     so with overlapping rows the slots in the MIDDLE of a block sit near the mean and
#     inject faintly while the edges inject strongly -- a 1.64x spread across 8 speakers,
#     and 2.22x across 4. Once the rows are near-orthogonal, ``|row_i - mean|`` is the
#     same for every i and the spread falls to 1.12x.

@experimental
class ParallelExpertEncoder(nn.Module):
    """PEE-v2 three-expert encoder; I/O identical to :class:`ConformerEncoder`.

    Reconstructed from inline configs in the PE bundle's ``model_config.yaml``.

    Args:
        speech_expert_cfg (DictConfig): Inline config for the speech MoE expert
            (``MoETransformerEncoder``, ``d_model`` 2048). Its output is the
            backbone that speaker activities are fused into.
        speaker_expert_cfg (DictConfig): Inline config for the Sortformer speaker
            expert (``TransformerEncoder``, ``d_model`` 1024).
        sound_expert_cfg (DictConfig): Inline config for the sound expert
            (``TransformerEncoder``, ``d_model`` 2048). Runs in the packed group;
            its output is returned unfused.
        sortformer_modules_cfg (DictConfig): Inline config for
            :class:`SortformerModules`, which supplies the speaker head
            (``encoder_proj`` + ``forward_speaker_sigmoids``) and the streaming
            speaker-cache logic. ``tf_d_model`` must match the checkpoint (192 on
            the v2 speaker), not be assumed equal to ``fc_d_model``.
        sound_ctc_head_cfg (DictConfig, optional): Inline config for the sound expert's
            CTC head (a :class:`ConvASRDecoder`), lifted from the sound checkpoint's
            ``decoder:`` block. Like the Sortformer head this is NOT part of the
            expert's encoder, so it is built here and loaded separately. Its
            ``vocabulary`` is what the ``<ev:...>`` column indices are read from.
            Required when ``merge_sound_expert_to_asr=False``, unused otherwise.
        asr_normalize_type (str, optional): Normalization applied to the shared mel
            input. Defaults to ``per_feature``, which every expert then sees --
            there is one packed call over one input tensor, so the three experts
            cannot be normalised differently. Pass ``None`` to feed raw mels.
        freeze_speaker (bool): Freeze the speaker expert + head. Defaults to ``True``.
            The speaker kernel is built from a hard threshold on the speaker
            activities, so no gradient reaches this branch through the fusion
            anyway -- freezing makes that explicit and saves the optimizer state.
        freeze_speech (bool): Freeze the speech expert. Defaults to ``False``.
        freeze_sound (bool): Freeze the sound expert. Defaults to ``False`` -- the
            sound expert trains alongside speech, and its states reach the loss
            through the merge. Only the speaker expert (the Sortformer diarizer,
            whose head is non-differentiable past the activity threshold) is frozen
            by default.
        online_inference_length (int): Generation-time window in encoder output
            frames (default ``375`` = 30 s at subsampling 8); ``<= 0`` disables
            windowing. Unused by training and validation, which encode in one pass.
        chunk_left_context (int): Left context (output frames) per window. Default ``50``.
        chunk_right_context (int): Right context (output frames) per window. Default ``50``.
        diar_fifo_len (int): Sortformer streaming ``fifo_len``. Default ``0``.
        diar_spkcache_update_period (int): Sortformer streaming
            ``spkcache_update_period``. Default ``375``. Values below
            ``chunk_len`` cannot be honoured -- the effective period is
            ``max(period, chunk_len)`` -- so the default matches ``chunk_len``.
        diar_spkcache_len (int): Sortformer streaming ``spkcache_len``. Default ``200``.
        missing_rttm_target (float): Sentinel marking rows that should use diarization
            predictions. Defaults to ``-1.0``.
        speaker_activity_threshold (float): Binarization threshold applied to RTTM and
            diarization targets before speaker-kernel fusion. Defaults to ``0.5``.
        spk_kernel_scale (float, optional): Weight of the speaker-kernel contribution.
            Defaults to ``0.75`` when ``spk_kernel_calibrate`` and ``1.0`` otherwise,
            because the two layouts measure it in different units -- see that argument.
        spk_kernel_row_stride (int): Spacing between the sinusoid rows the speaker kernel
            takes. Defaults to ``1`` -- rows ``0 … n_spk-1``, the layout v2.0.0 was built
            and trained against, so a bundle that does not set this reloads unchanged.
            New bundles set ``16``, which makes the speaker rows near-orthogonal: the
            worst speaker-pair cosine drops from 0.858 to 0.163 and the spread in
            per-speaker injection strength from 1.64x to 1.12x. See ``_TAG_ROW_STRIDE``.
        spk_kernel_calibrate (bool): Rescale the speaker kernel so one active speaker
            injects ``sqrt(d_model)``, making ``spk_kernel_scale`` a *fraction of the ASR
            state magnitude* directly comparable to ``sound_kernel_scale`` and independent
            of ``n_spk``. Uncalibrated, the same scale injects 0.36 of the state magnitude
            at ``n_spk=4`` but 0.75 at ``n_spk=8``. Defaults to ``False`` so that v2.0.0
            bundles, whose speech expert was trained on the raw kernel, reload
            bit-identically; new bundles set it. Changing it on a trained checkpoint moves
            the kernel out from under the weights that learned to read it.
        sync_max_audio_length (bool): Let the experts all-reduce their maximum sequence
            length on the default process group. Defaults to ``False``; leave it off
            unless every rank is guaranteed to run the encoder on every step, since the
            reduction is emitted from inside a data-dependent branch.
        always_run_diarization (bool): Run the speaker head on every single-pass forward
            instead of only when some row requests predicted diarization. Defaults to
            ``True`` so the collective schedule cannot depend on batch content.
        moe_mode (str): ``'dense'`` or ``'topk'`` for the speech MoE inside the grouped
            FFN. Defaults to ``'dense'``.
        ggemm_backend (str): Grouped-GEMM backend. Defaults to ``'baddbmm'``.
        online_prefix_mode (str): How the speaker's streaming cache is spliced in the
            windowed path. ``'replace'`` (default) walks each window's start back by
            the cache length and lets the cache stand in for the speaker's leading
            frames, so speech and sound spend those slots on real left context instead
            of zero padding -- same FLOPs, and the packed group stays
            FlashAttention-2 eligible. ``'extend'`` is the older behaviour: the cache
            lengthens the speaker and the other experts are zero-padded to match.
            Windows too near the start of a recording to walk back far enough fall
            back to ``'extend'`` automatically.
        merge_sound_expert_to_asr (bool): How the sound expert reaches the ASR states.
            ``False`` (default since v2.1.0) selects the **SoundToken** path: the CTC
            head reads per-frame ``<ev:...>`` and ``<sty:stt|end:...>`` probabilities
            out of the sound states, and those are thresholded at
            ``sound_event_threshold``, LayerNorm-ed per family and injected through
            ``sound_token_kernel`` / ``sound_style_kernel`` -- exactly as the speaker
            sigmoids go through ``diar_kernel``. Requires ``sound_ctc_head_cfg``.
            ``True`` instead adds the sound expert's **encoder states**, LayerNorm-ed
            and scaled by ``sound_merge_scale``; that was the v2.0.0 behaviour and
            needs no CTC head.
        sound_merge_scale (float): Relative weight of the sound stream in the merged
            backbone, mirroring ``spk_kernel_scale``. Both streams are normalized
            first, and they are near-orthogonal in practice (measured cosine
            ~0.004), so a scale of ``s`` gives sound a variance share of roughly
            ``s^2 / (1 + s^2)``: 0.3 -> ~8%, 0.5 -> ~20%, 1.0 -> ~50%.
            Defaults to ``0.3``, a deliberately modest starting weight because the
            sound expert is trained on far less data (~2.6 kh) than the speech
            backbone. This is a starting point, not a ceiling: ``sound_norm`` keeps
            a learnable affine gain and the sound expert itself trains, so the
            model can grow the contribution if the loss rewards it.
            Ignored when ``merge_sound_expert_to_asr=False``.
        sound_event_threshold (float): Probability above which an event or style tag
            counts as present, before the kernel injection. Defaults to ``0.5``,
            mirroring ``speaker_activity_threshold``. Only read on the SoundToken path.
        sound_kernel_scale (float): Weight of the event-kernel contribution, the sound
            twin of ``spk_kernel_scale`` and on the same calibrated footing: a fraction of
            the ASR state magnitude, independent of how many event tags there are.
            ``asr_encoded`` arrives from the speech expert's ``final_norm``, so it too has
            norm ``~sqrt(d_model)``. Defaults to ``0.75``, level with the speaker kernel.
            Only read on the SoundToken path.
        inject_sound_styles (bool): Whether to also inject the 22 ``<sty:stt|end:...>``
            span delimiters as their own tag family. Defaults to ``True``. When
            ``False`` only the event tags are injected and no style kernel is built,
            which is the v2.1.0-rc behaviour. Only read on the SoundToken path.
        sound_style_scale (float): Weight of the style-kernel contribution, on the same
            calibrated footing, so it is directly comparable to ``sound_kernel_scale``
            despite the family being 22 tags rather than 10. Defaults to ``0.75``. Kept a
            separate knob because the sound expert is markedly weaker on styles than on
            events, and this ships at the value that *balances* styles against the states
            rather than one shown to help: ``0.0`` mutes them while leaving the event path
            bit-identical. Only read on the SoundToken path.
