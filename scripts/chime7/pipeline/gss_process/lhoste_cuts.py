    Splits each input cut into as many cuts as there are supervisions.
    These cuts have identical start times and durations as the supervisions.

        keep_overlapping: when `False`, it will discard parts of other supervisions that overlap with the main supervision. In the illustration, it would discard `Sup2` in `Cut1` and `Sup1` in `Cut2`.
        min_duration: An optional duration in seconds; specifying this argument will extend the cuts
            that would have been shorter than `min_duration` with actual acoustic context in the recording/features.
            If there are supervisions present in the context, they are kept when `keep_overlapping` is true.
            If there is not enough context, the returned cut will be shorter than `min_duration`.
            If the supervision segment is longer than `min_duration`, the return cut will be longer.
        context_diraction: Which direction should the cut be expanded towards to include context.
            The value of "center" implies equal expansion to left and right;
            "random" uniformly samples a value between "left" and "right".

            the trimmed cut will have the same channels as the supervision.
