## Introduction

NVIDIA NeMo Speech is built for researchers and PyTorch developers working on Speech models including Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR), Text to Speech (TTS), and Speech LLMs. It is designed to help you efficiently create, customize, and
deploy new AI models by leveraging existing code and pre-trained model checkpoints.

For technical documentation, please see the
[NeMo Framework User Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/speech/nightly/).

## Requirements

NeMo Speech works with the **Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions of your choosing**:

- Python 3.12 or above
- PyTorch 2.7 or above (CPU, CUDA, etc. — your choice)
- NVIDIA GPU + CUDA (required for training; recommended for inference)

If you already have a Python/PyTorch/CUDA stack that satisfies those minimums, NeMo Speech installs on top of it **without replacing it**, so your existing PyTorch build is kept (see the install options below). The versions pinned in `uv.lock` and shipped in the official container — Python 3.13, PyTorch 2.12, CUDA 12.6/13.2 — are simply the combination we actively test and support. They make setup turnkey and reproducible, but they are **not** a hard requirement.

As of [Pytorch 2.6](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html#torch-load-with-weights-only-true),
`torch.load` defaults to using `weights_only=True`. Some model checkpoints may require using `weights_only=False`.
In this case, you can set the env var `TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1` before running code that uses `torch.load`.
However, this should only be done with trusted files. Loading files from untrusted sources with more than weights only
can have the risk of arbitrary code execution.

## Install NeMo Speech

The recommended way to install NeMo Speech is from source with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which reproduces our actively-tested stack from the committed `uv.lock`. If you need different Python/PyTorch/CUDA versions, NeMo also installs over your existing environment via pip — see the [pip fallback](#from-pypi-with-pip-fallback--bring-your-own-versions) below.

### From source with uv (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo.git
cd NeMo
uv sync --extra all --extra cu13     # CUDA 13.x (recommended) — use --extra cu12 for CUDA 12.x
```

This installs our supported stack (Python 3.13, PyTorch 2.12, CUDA 13.2) into `.venv/` with NeMo editable. Add `--group test` for the test suite or `--group docs` to build the docs; run tools via `uv run <cmd>` or activate with `source .venv/bin/activate`. On Linux, `cu12` and `cu13` are mutually exclusive — pass exactly one (`cu13` is the default). For the **exact** container baseline, add `--locked --python 3.13` (the path the Dockerfile and CI use).

> **SpeechLM2 / Automodel:** the Automodel backend runs **without** any compiled dependencies. It can *optionally* benefit from dedicated accelerated backends (Transformer Engine, FlashAttention, Mamba, grouped-GEMM/MoE, DeepEP) for better performance — these source-built kernels come from the `compiled` (Hopper/Blackwell) or `compiled-a100` (A100) extras, built by `docker/Dockerfile` (`GPU_TARGET=h100plus` / `a100`). See the [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/speech/nightly/) for the full list and build details.

### Docker (turnkey, our supported stack)

> **NGC container:** _Coming soon — the pull command for the prebuilt NeMo Speech container image will be published here._

To build the container from source (CUDA 13 / H100+ by default):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo.git
cd NeMo
docker buildx build -f docker/Dockerfile -t nemo-speech .          # CUDA 13 / H100+ (default)
docker run --rm -it --gpus all -v "$PWD:/workspace" nemo-speech bash
```

For A100, set `GPU_TARGET=a100` — A100 works with **both CUDA 12 and CUDA 13** (CUDA 13, the default base image, is recommended; the CUDA 12 base is a convenience). See the header of [`docker/Dockerfile`](docker/Dockerfile) for all build arguments (`BASE_IMAGE`, `GPU_TARGET`).

### From PyPI with pip (fallback — bring your own versions)

Prefer your own Python/PyTorch/CUDA? Install your PyTorch first (any version ≥ 2.7 for your CPU/CUDA/etc. target — see the [PyTorch install matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)), then add NeMo and it **keeps your build**. `uv pip` (uv's fast, pip-compatible installer) works like `pip`:

```bash
uv pip install 'nemo-toolkit[asr,tts]'   # or plain: pip install 'nemo-toolkit[asr,tts]'
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** use `uv sync --locked` for a bring-your-own stack — it applies `uv.lock` and replaces your Python/PyTorch/CUDA with the supported baseline. Use `uv pip`/`pip` here; reserve `uv sync --locked` for reproducing our stack.

To instead pull *our* pinned PyTorch build, add the CUDA extra and the matching wheel index (pip/uv pip do not read uv's project index config, so `--extra-index-url` is required):

```bash
pip install 'nemo-toolkit[asr,tts,cu13]' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu132   # CUDA 13.x
pip install 'nemo-toolkit[asr,tts,cu12]' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126   # CUDA 12.x
```
